Fire Data Analysis Script
--------------------------
This script processes and visualizes fire event data derived from satellite observations.
It leverages data produced by the MODIS C6.1 sensor, with the following metadata:

    Data Source     : MODIS C6.1
    Start Date      : 2000-11-01
    End Date        : 2025-01-16
    Output Format   : csv
    Area of Interest: Montenegro

The original data can be accessed at: https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov

The script executes the following workflow:
  1. Loads the data with robust error handling.
  2. Preprocesses the data by cleaning and converting date‚Äêtime fields.
  3. Summarizes the data by aggregating fire events on annual and monthly bases.
  4. Generates visualizations including:
       - A line chart showing the number of fires per year.
       - A bar chart illustrating the average number of fires per month.
       - A heatmap representing the distribution of fire events by year and month.

Requirements:
  - Python 3.x
  - numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

This modular code is ready for publication on GitHub.
